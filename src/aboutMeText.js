  My software journey started in the days of Angelfire hosting, when I built a website for my squadron in 
  Subspace (link) comprised of iframes and hand-drawn graphics. A while later I built a Flash app (RIP, Homestar Runner) to showcase 
  my awesome skills and leet KD ratios in Counter-Strike 1.5 (I hope the sarcasm is coming through). 
  In college I studied mechanical engineering to pursue robotics and loved my
  mechatronics programming courses, learning assembly language for Motorola 68HC12, and writing C and C++ for
  various projects such as a line-following robot and object-tracking heliostat array (link).
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  When I got into industry as a mechanical engineer, I continued pursuing software for various side projects 
  that I wanted to build. I pursued building a social networking site that would group people together based 
  on location and similar interests called Looper (unfortunately, looper.com was already owned by someone else 
  and they were asking $5,000 for the purchase -- pivot!). I looked into using Elgg 1.8 for this (even bought a book) but my ambitions were much higher
  than my skillset could handle.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

  Around 2015 I had an idea for an iPhone app and I took a Udemy course on iPhone development to learn how to build it. 
  I completed the app and published it to the Apple app store (First Thought) and it got a whopping 13 downloads
  and one five star review (thanks Dad!). Soon after that I found out about freecodecamp.org (link) and began learning 
  about web developent. From then on, I was hooked. Around this time my Dad told me about an idea (thanks again Dad!)
  for an app that help demystify the wild west of streaming services, back when people actually switched to streaming 
  services to save money. Thus, Showpaca was born. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

  I worked the next two years on Showpaca in the early morning hours (waking around 4-4:30AM) before work, and often during lunch, 
  fiddling with the UI, the UX, the front-end, the back-end, countless hours smacking my head against the wall trying
  to get the thing hosted on AWS; learning the quirks of Next.js; writing scrapers
  to pull information from various websites; writing scripts to format and upload the data into my nosql databases; 
  writing emails to streaming service providers begging for access to their channels-list APIs;
  making sure the app worked on desktop, and iPhone, and Adroid, and Safari, and Firefox, and Chrome, and IE Edge, and IE 7 
  (just kidding, sorry IE 7, it's not you, it's me); troubleshooting why my selection algorithm was timing out and giving unexpected answers, 
  then learning about and implementing A* and getting the correct answers but still taking a while, then adding in more
  optimizations like binary search and caching and hashmaps and getting correct answers and quick speeds (hooray!); and lastly,
  the thrill of publishing to Facebook and seeing the user count spike in Google Ads.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

  After Showpaca I worked on the various other projects included on this site. I love that software can 
  be built for free, published to the web, and be accessed by nearly every one in the world.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

  I took a slight detour at some point into data science and machine learning, attending a meetup for about 
  a year and a half. I met some incredibly nice and smart people, worked on several interesting data science problems
  (mostly from Kaggle) and got recruited to do some work for a startup trying to end cancer. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

  All throughout my software journey I have loved learning not just about the language, frameworks, or general concepts,
  but really trying to dig deep and learn core CS concepts. I've been amazed at the number of free resources for learning,
  especially from top universities like MIT and Hardvard. Harvard's CS50 is hands-down one of the best courses I've taken 
  in any subject. Freecodecamp.org is doing amazing work in bringing code to life for beginners.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

  Outside of my day job and software, I love spending time with my family and also playing disc golf. I'm still pretty new to
  the game, but I've been treating it as another learning venture: start with the fundamentals and build upon those.
  Disc golf is fun, relaxing, and great exercise.

I love solving problems, and I love using code to do it. I love blending creativity with technology
to create solutions that are both aesthetically pleasing and wildly efficient. I believe a design is done
not when nothing more can be added to it, nor when anything more can be removed from it, but when it fulfills its purpose in a beautiful way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I love systems that are efficient, with no wasted effort -- no unnecessary clicks, loading times, 
cognitive load, or memory used.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I've run two 50k trail races.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I love disc golf -- not only is a great form of exercise and a casual enviroment to spend time
in nature, spend time conversing with friends, and participating in competition, but it requires
on-the-spot calculation; what is the wind vector? Which route do I take to get to the basket? Do I need
clockwise or counter-clockwise spin? What will be my launch angle? Which disc will have the right flight
characteristics I need? How will my footing impact the throw? How hard do I need to throw, and how much spin
do I need to put on the disc? And then putting all these calculations into place. It is a wonderful blend
of both physical and mental ability.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I love learning -- via books, podcasts, and online lectures. I love learning about business, software design, 
nanotechnology, quantum computing, neurology, algorithms, automation, and parenting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I love innovating -- coming up with and putting into practice new ideas that help people.
